      Analysed and accounted for the systematic error in centroiding algorithms like Centre of Mass (CoM) to increase the accuracy of finding the centre of star images. 
      Responsibilities include:
      - Worked on error-predicting algorithms like the Extreme Learning Machine with Bat algorithm as an optimiser (BA-ELM), 1D Gaussian Fitting, and Fast Gaussian Fitting; BA-ELM algorithm increased the accuracy of the CoM algorithm by 40%.
      - Analysed image smoothing algorithms like Savitzky-Golay Filters and their effect on CoM accuracy.
      - Evaluated star tracking algorithms to predict the centroid locations for faster extraction of stars from an image.

    #   Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
